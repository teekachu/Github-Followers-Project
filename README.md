# Github-Followers 
A course taught by Sean Allen. 


This app allows the user to search for any Github member based on their profile username. The user then can view a list of such member's followers, click into any follower's profile and view related detail such as but not limited to :  profile name, location, job title, number of public repos and gists, as well as the number of followers they have, and number of other members they are following. 

The user could also add a member as favorites, and get quick access to their profile.
